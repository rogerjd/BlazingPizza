In Blazor, I have <tr onclick>  it works. But, on click I would like to paint the selected row and only the selected row yellow. I don' know how to do this in the event, can you show how?

To highlight a selected row in a table when it is clicked in Blazor, you can achieve this by using a combination of event handling and CSS. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement this:

1. **Create a CSS class for the highlighted row:**

```css
<style>
    .highlight {
        background-color: yellow;
    }
</style>
```

2. **Set up the Blazor component with a table:**

```razor
@page "/highlightrow"

@* The selected row variable *@
@code {
    private int? selectedRowIndex = null;

    private void SelectRow(int index)
    {
        selectedRowIndex = index;
    }
}
```

3. **Create the table with rows that can be clicked:**

```razor
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Header 1</th>
            <th>Header 2</th>
            <th>Header 3</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        @for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            <tr onclick="() => SelectRow(i)" class="@(selectedRowIndex == i ? "highlight" : "")">
                <td>@($"Row {i} - Column 1")</td>
                <td>@($"Row {i} - Column 2")</td>
                <td>@($"Row {i} - Column 3")</td>
            </tr>
        }
    </tbody>
</table>
```

### Explanation:

1. **CSS Class:** We defined a `.highlight` class in the CSS to apply a yellow background color.

2. **Blazor Code:** 
   - We have a nullable `selectedRowIndex` variable that keeps track of the currently selected row.
   - The `SelectRow` method sets `selectedRowIndex` to the index of the clicked row.

3. **Table Rows:** 
   - We use a loop to generate table rows.
   - Each row has an `onclick` event that calls the `SelectRow` method with the row's index.
   - We use a conditional class binding to apply the `highlight` class only to the selected row by comparing `selectedRowIndex` with the row's index.

This approach ensures that only the clicked row gets highlighted, and the highlight is removed from the previously selected row.
